    <p id="pageText">Your adventurous spirit eventually gets the best of you, and you decide
      to wander outside. The air is nice and cool, and the grassy plains stretch out in front
      of you for miles as the sunlight from the rising sun seems to glisten off each individual
      blade of grass. As soon as you step outside, you feel sharp claws grip onto both of your
      shoulder blades. You look up to see a giant falcon about three times your size carrying you
      away from your house, likely to its nest. But you do not hesitate. You swing your sword at the
      falcon’s claws, and it drops you instantly as it cries out in pain. You brace yourself for the
      fall, and you land on the ground with a soft *thump*. It hurts a little, but you are still alive.</p>
