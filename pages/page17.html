  <p id="pageText">You decide to stand still and take both giant falcons head on.
    A brave choice, but a stupid one nevertheless. <br>
    You swing your sword at one falcon and it flies away,
    but as the next one comes at you you find yourself defenseless against it.
    The falcon grabs you by the shoulders, and as it takes you higher and higher
    into the sky, you swear that you can hear the other falcon laughing maniacally
    at your poor decision making skills. <br>
    Tip: Bravery isn't always the best option.
