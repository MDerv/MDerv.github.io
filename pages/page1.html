    <p id="pageText">Your adventurous spirit eventually gets the best of you, and you decide to wander outside. The air is nice and cool, and the grassy plains stretch out in front of you for miles as the sunlight from the rising sun seems to glisten off each individual blade of grass.
Unfortunately, you forgot rule #1 of adventuring: bring a weapon.
As soon as you step outside, you feel sharp claws grip onto both of your shoulder blades. You look up to see a giant falcon about three times your size carrying you away from your house, likely to its nest. As the falcon’s claws dig deeper into your bones, you think to yourself, “Maybe I should have gotten my sword first.”
The thought is short lived, and soon thereafter you get eaten by the giant bird.
Tip: Always carry a weapon with you.</p>
