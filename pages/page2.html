    <p id="pageText">Your adventurous spirit eventually gets the best of you, and you decide to wander outside.
      The air is nice and cool, and the grassy plains stretch out in front of you for miles as the sunlight
      from the rising sun seems to glisten off each individual blade of grass. As soon as you step outside, you feel
      sharp claws grip onto both of your shoulder blades. You look up to see a giant falcon about three times your size
      carrying you away from your house, likely to its nest. But you do not hesitate. You swing your sword at the
      falcon’s claws, and it drops you instantly as it cries out in pain. Unfortunately, you forgot rule #2 of adventuring:
      always have a good breakfast. As you fall, you realize that the ground was much farther away than you expected.
      You land on the ground with a hard *thonk*. You try to get up, but you feel the energy slowly draining from you.
      You think to yourself, “Maybe I should have had breakfast,” but the thought comes too late, and the angry
      falcon eats you soon thereafter.<br>
      Tip: Make sure to replenish your energy often.</p>
