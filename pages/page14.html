  <p id="pageText">You continue to run straight, and you feel the claw of one of the birds
    make a giant gash in your neck. You stumble and fall to the ground, trying to stop the bleeding.
    You feel your energy slowly draining from you, and struggle to get back on your feet.
    You’re so drained that you can hardly feel the sharp claws of the falcon, carrying your lifeless body through the skies.
