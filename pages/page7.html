  <p id="pageText">You think to yourself, “Running is for suckas” and decide to stand in place and fight.
    But you and your puny sword stand no chance against the giant falcon. <br>
    The falcon easily bats away your sword and scoops you up with its giant claws.
    You think to yourself, “Maybe I should have run,” but the thought is short lived.
    Almost as short lived, in fact, as your lifespan. Almost. <br>
    Tip: Bravery isn't always the best option.
